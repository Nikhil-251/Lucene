UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Iraq,guidelines,Iraq,UNHCR,2002-09-31T23:59:59Z,https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4fc77d522.pdf,"These Eligibility Guidelines replace the April 2009 UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the
International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Iraq and the 2010 Note on the Continued
Applicability of the April 2009 UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International
Protection Needs of Iraqi Asylum-Seekers.1
The purpose of these Eligibility Guidelines is to set out the profiles of asylum-seekers for whom
international protection needs are likely to arise in the current context in Iraq.2
The current situation in Iraq can be characterized as one of ongoing uncertainty due to several factors,
including: (i) high levels of political and sectarian violence; (ii) the unpredictable security situation,
including significant numbers of civilian casualties as a result of attacks by armed groups; (iii) the full
withdrawal of US forces from Iraq at the end of 2011; and (iv) continuing challenges with regard to
establishment of the rule of law, provision of services, distribution of land, and respect for human
rights.
UNHCR’s recommendations with regard to assessing the international protection needs of asylum-
seekers from Iraq, as set out in these Eligibility Guidelines, may be summarized as follows.
All claims lodged by asylum-seekers - whether on the basis of the refugee criteria contained in the
1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees3 and/or its 1967 Protocol4 (1951 Convention), or
broader international protection criteria, including complementary forms of protection - need to be
considered on their own merits in fair and efficient status determination procedures and based on up-
to-date and relevant country of origin information.
UNHCR considers that asylum-seekers from Iraq with the following profiles, and depending on the
particular circumstances of the individual case, are likely to be in need of international refugee
protection. These risk profiles are not necessarily exhaustive, nor is there any hierarchy implied in the
order in which they are presented:
(i) individuals associated with (or perceived to be supporting) the Iraqi authorities, the
Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) or the former foreign forces in Iraq (Multinational Forces
in Iraq, MNF-I or US Forces in Iraq, USF-I);
(ii) individuals (perceived as) opposing the Iraqi authorities;
(iii) individuals (perceived as) opposing the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG);
(iv) certain professionals;
(v) individuals with religion-based claims,
(vi) individuals with ethnicity-based claims;
(vii) women with specific profiles or in specific circumstances;
(viii) children with specific profiles or in specifc circumstances;
(ix) victims or persons at risk of trafficking; and
(x) lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals.
In light of the ongoing non-international armed conflict,5 related civilian casualties, security incidents
and conflict-induced displacement, in particular in central Iraq,6 UNHCR recommends that
international protection applications lodged by Iraqis claiming to flee high levels of and/or intense
violence should each be assessed carefully, in light of the evidence presented by the applicant and
other current and reliable information on their place of former residence. This will include an
assessment of whether the violence in the place of former residence is of such a level and intensity
7
that international protection is required under complementary protection regimes, even if the
protection need cannot be related to a 1951 Convention ground.
UNHCR considers that internal flight options are often not available in Iraq due to serious risks faced
by Iraqis throughout the country, including threats to safety and security, accessibility problems and
lack of livelihood opportunities.
In light of the serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law during the
former regime of Saddam Hussein from 1979 – 2003 (the “former regime”), as well as in the past
decade, exclusion considerations under Article 1F of the 1951 Convention may arise in certain
individual cases. Careful consideration is particularly required for Iraqi asylum-seekers with the
following profiles: (i) members of the former regime (1979 – 2003); (ii) members of armed groups
opposing the former regime (1979 – 2003); (iii) members of the ISF, the Iraqi Government, the
Kurdish Security Forces and the Sahwa (since 2003); (iv) members of armed groups (since 2003); and
(v) members of criminal groups (since 2003).
In preparing these Eligibility Guidelines, UNHCR has analysed the most up-to-date and relevant
information available from a wide variety of sources at 18 March 2012. However, access to fully
comprehensive information on the situation in Iraq is not always accessible for a variety of reasons. In
addition to publicly available sources, the analysis contained in these Eligibility Guidelines is also
informed by reliable reports provided by: (i) Iraqi asylum-seekers and refugees around the world; (ii)
internally displaced person (IDP) and returnee monitoring operations in Iraq; and (iii) UNHCR
operations, UN agencies and other partners in Iraq."
UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Sri Lanka,guidelines sri_lanka_focused,Sri Lanka,UNHCR,1999-12-31T23:59:59Z,https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/49de0b6b2.pdf,"Sri Lankan nationals have been seeking protection as refugees in neighbouring countries and much further a field in ever increasing numbers. This paper provides guidance for UNHCR and State adjudicators in deciding claims submitted by Sri Lankan asylum-seekers, and in otherwise understanding and responding appropriately to their protection needs. These Guidelines supersede the “UNHCR Position on the International Protection Needs of Asylum–Seekers from Sri Lanka”, issued in December 2006.1
The Guidelines are divided into three sections including this Introduction (Section I). Section II provides background information regarding Sri Lanka, including an overview of the  current political, security and human rights situation and a summary of the main groups at risk. Section III provides guidance on the assessment of eligibility of Sri Lankan asylum- seekers in light of the available country of origin information and the legal framework under Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention, and sets out UNHCR’s recommendations on the international protection needs of Sri Lankan asylum-seekers.
When UNHCR’s 2006 position was issued, the armed conflict between the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) and the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam (LTTE) had resumed following the failure of the Ceasefire Agreement of 2002. Fighting was heavily concentrated in the North2 and the East3 of the country, where civilians were exposed to widespread insecurity and the risk of serious and indiscriminate harm related to the conflict. Furthermore, in these regions, and throughout Sri Lanka, targeted human rights violations were being committed by both State and non-State entities. While individuals from each of the three major ethnic groups, Sinhalese, Muslim and Tamil, were affected, Tamils from the North and the East were considered to be at particularly high risk of human rights violations in Sri Lanka.
In the 2006 position, UNHCR recommended that claims by asylum seekers from Sri Lanka be examined carefully in fair and efficient refugee status determination procedures and that individuals who met the criteria in the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees4 (“1951 Convention”) and/or its 1967 Protocol5 be recognized on this basis. The  2006 position further recommended that, in view of the situation of generalized violence resulting from the armed conflict in the North and the East, asylum seekers from these regions who did not meet the criteria for recognition under the 1951 Convention, and were not considered to have a realistic internal flight or relocation alternative (IFA/IRA) in other parts of the country, should be recognized under an extended refugee definition, where applicable, or otherwise granted a complementary form of protection. As Tamils from the North and East were considered to be at risk of serious harm in all parts of the country, UNHCR considered that no IFA/IRA was available to Tamils from these regions and that all were in need of international protection.
Since the issuance of UNHCR’s 2006 position, important developments have taken place in Sri Lanka, most notably with respect to the fighting between the SLA and the LTTE in the North and East and the intensification of the Government’s security and anti-insurgency operations in many parts of the country. Updated eligibility guidance is therefore considered to be necessary to take into account these new developments.
Throughout Sri Lanka, the acts of violence and human rights abuses highlighted in the 2006 position paper, including abductions, disappearances, assaults, extortion, forced recruitment and extra-judicial killings continue to be committed with impunity by multiple actors. As the SLA has recaptured LTTE-controlled territory in the North, the LTTE has engaged in human rights violations and breaches of humanitarian law against civilians in the North and stepped up attacks on Government and civilian targets in other parts of Sri Lanka, in particular in and around the capital, Colombo. The Government’s counter-insurgency operations and heightened security measures to curtail LTTE activities have themselves been associated with serious violations of human rights, in particular against Tamils from the North and East, and have not been effective in containing the incidents of political and ethnic violence which continue to undermine the security of civilians in many communities in the  country.  Freedom of expression is seriously curtailed in Sri Lanka. Journalists, human rights activists, politicians, humanitarian workers and others who criticize, or are otherwise perceived to oppose Government or LTTE actions or policies are at risk of suffering serious harm. Violations of the rights of women and children, in particular in the conflict zones and areas of heavy displacement, are a serious problem. There are growing concerns regarding the rule of law, the administration of justice and the investigation and punishment of criminal acts, including serious violations of human rights. Many individuals from Sri Lanka who seek asylum as a result of these developments will be eligible for refugee protection under the 1951 Convention.
In view of the prevailing human rights situation, claims by individuals from Sri Lanka should continue to be assessed in fair and efficient refugee status determination procedures, taking into consideration the evolving security and human rights situation in specific regions of the country and the information in these updated Guidelines regarding the categories of individuals who may be in need of international protection.
Where the availability of an internal flight or relocation alternative (IFA/IRA) is considered, this determination should be based on an assessment of both the relevance and the reasonableness of an identified IFA/IRA for the asylum seeker in light of his or her individual profile and circumstances. Careful consideration should be given inter alia to the specific security and human rights situation in the relevant parts of the country, the significant restrictions on the mobility of persons fleeing harm in Sri Lanka, and the broad geographic reach of both State and non-State agents of persecution. Because of the activities and affiliations frequently attributed to Tamils from the North and East, UNHCR considers that Tamils from these regions continue to be at risk of human rights violations in other parts of the country and are, therefore, without a reasonable IFA/IRA in Sri Lanka. Given the regular LTTE attacks in Colombo and the adverse impact of the Government’s anti-terrorism measures upon Tamils, Colombo is not considered to be a reasonable IFA/IRA for Tamils fleeing the North and East of the country.
In view of the ongoing situation of generalized violence related to the ongoing armed conflict in the North, UNHCR’s recommendation in the 2006 position regarding the eligibility of asylum seekers from the North of Sri Lanka remains unchanged. Claims by asylum seekers who do not meet the criteria for recognition under the 1951 Convention, and do not have an

IFA/IRA in another part of the country, should be considered under an extended refugee definition, where applicable, or accorded a complementary form of protection6. Given the extensive and reliable evidence of widespread targeted human rights violations against Tamils in and from the North, by the parties to the armed conflict and other paramilitary actors, UNHCR considers that Tamil asylum-seekers from the North of Sri Lanka should be recognized as refugees under the 1951 Convention absent clear and reliable indicators that they do not meet the relevant criteria. In contexts where individual refugee status determination is not feasible to determine the claims of Tamil asylum seekers from the North of Sri Lanka, UNHCR encourages the adoption of a prima facie approach.
As open fighting related to the armed conflict has essentially ended in the East, the risk to civilians of serious and indiscriminate harm in the cross-fire of fighting is now considered to be remote. UNHCR is, therefore, no longer recommending the application of an extended refugee definition, or complementary forms of protection on this basis alone and UNHCR’s advice is revised accordingly in these Guidelines. Nevertheless, in light of the regular incidents of ethnic and communal violence in the East and the widespread human rights violations committed by both State and non-State actors against individuals of specific profiles, in particular Tamils, many asylum seekers from the East will continue to be in need of international protection and their eligibility should continue to be evaluated in light of the criteria in the 1951 Convention.
During the protracted civil war which has been waged in Sri Lanka, extensive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have occurred. Exclusion issues may, therefore, arise in individual claims for refugee status, in particular those involving individuals who have participated in the armed conflict. The possible application of the exclusion clauses should be examined in claims by former members of the LTTE or other paramilitary groups, as well as former members of military, security or law enforcement forces in Sri Lanka. Given the potentially serious consequences of exclusion from international refugee protection, the exclusion clauses should be applied with great caution and only after a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the case.
Should asylum seekers from Sri Lanka who are determined not to be eligible for international refugee protection demonstrate needs for which another form of protection may be required, the appropriate response should be assessed accordingly. In this regard, States’ obligations under international human rights law remain unaffected."
UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Afghanistan,guidelines,Aghanistan,UNHCR,2000-01-31T23:59:59Z,https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/51ffdca34.pdf,"These Guidelines supersede the December 2010 UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the
International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Afghanistan.1 They are issued against a
background of continuing concerns about the security situation in parts of Afghanistan and about
widespread human rights abuses. They contain information on particular profiles for which
international protection needs may arise in the current context in Afghanistan.
UNHCR has included in these Guidelines the most up-to-date information available at the time of
writing, from a wide variety of sources.2 The analysis contained in these Guidelines is informed by
publicly available information as well as by information collected and obtained by UNHCR in the
course of its operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere, as well as by other UN agencies and partner
organizations.
All claims lodged by asylum-seekers need to be considered on their own merits according to fair and
efficient status determination procedures and up-to-date and relevant country of origin information.
This applies whether the claims are analysed on the basis of the refugee criteria contained in the 1951
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (“1951 Convention”)3, UNHCR’s mandate, regional
refugee instruments, or on the basis of broader international protection criteria, including
complementary forms of protection.
Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention
People fleeing Afghanistan may be at risk of persecution for reasons that are related to the ongoing
armed conflict in Afghanistan, or on the basis of serious human rights violations that are not directly
related to the conflict, or a combination of the two. UNHCR considers that in relation to individuals
with the following profiles a particularly careful examination of possible risks is required:
(i) Individuals associated with, or perceived as supportive of, the Government and the
international community, including the international military forces (IMF);
(ii) Journalists and other media professionals;
(iii) Men and boys of fighting age;
(iv) Civilians suspected of supporting anti-government elements (AGEs);
(v) Members of minority religious groups, and persons perceived as contravening Sharia law;
(vi) Individuals perceived as contravening the Taliban’s interpretation of Islamic principles, norms
and values;
(vii) Women;
(viii) Children;
(ix) Victims of trafficking or bonded labour and persons at risk of being trafficked or of bonded
labour;
(x) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals;
(xi) Members of (minority) ethnic groups;
(xii) Individuals involved in blood feuds; and
(xiii) (Family members of) business people and other people of means.
This listing is not necessarily exhaustive and is based on information available to UNHCR at the time
of writing. Hence, a claim should not automatically be considered as without merit simply because it
does not fall within any of the profiles identified here. Depending on the specific circumstances of the
case, family members or other members of the households of individuals with these profiles may also
be in need of international protection on the basis of their association with individuals at risk.

Afghanistan continues to be affected by a non-international armed conflict.4 Individuals fleeing harm
or the threat of harm in the context of this conflict may meet the criteria for refugee status as
contained in Article 1(A)(2) of the 1951 Convention. For this to be the case, there must be a
reasonable possibility that the individual would experience serious harm amounting to persecution for
reasons related to the grounds set out in Article 1(A)(2).
Human rights violations and other consequences of exposure to conflict-related violence may amount
to persecution within Article 1(A)(2) of the 1951 Convention, either independently or cumulatively.
In the context of the conflict in Afghanistan, relevant factors in assessing the human rights violations
or other serious harm that would be reasonably possible for an individual fleeing the conflict include
(i) the control over civilian populations by anti-government elements (AGEs), including through the
imposition of parallel justice structures and the meting out of illegal punishments, as well as by means
of threats and intimidation of civilians, restrictions on freedom of movement, and the use of extortion
and illegal taxation; (ii) forced recruitment; (iii) the impact of violence and insecurity on the
humanitarian situation as manifested by food insecurity, poverty and the destruction of livelihoods;
(iv) increasing levels of organized crime and the ability of warlords and corrupt government officials
to operate with impunity in government-controlled areas; (v) systematic constraints on access to
education or basic health care; and (vi) systematic constraints on participation in public life, including
in particular for women.5
For an individual who flees harm or the threat of harm in the context of the armed conflict in
Afghanistan to meet the criteria for refugee status as contained in Article 1(A)(2) of the 1951
Convention, the persecution flowing from the violence must also be for reason of a 1951 Convention
ground. In the context of Afghanistan, examples of circumstances where civilians are subjected to
violence for a 1951 Convention ground include situations where violence is targeted at areas where
civilians of specific ethnic, political or religious profiles predominantly reside, or at locations where
civilians of such profiles predominantly gather (including markets, mosques, schools, or large social
gatherings such as weddings). To qualify for refugee status there is no requirement that an individual
be known personally to the agent(s) of persecution or be sought out personally by those agents.
Similarly, entire communities may have a well-founded fear of persecution for one or more of the
1951 Convention grounds; there is no requirement that an individual suffer a form or degree of harm
that differs from that suffered by other individuals with the same profile.6
Broader UNHCR Mandate Criteria, Regional Instruments and Complementary Forms of
Protection
The 1951 Convention forms the cornerstone of the international refugee protection of regime. The
criteria for refugee status in the 1951 Convention need to be interpreted in such a manner that
individuals or groups of persons who meet these criteria are duly recognized and protected under that
instrument. Only when an asylum-seeker is found not to meet the refugee criteria in the 1951
Convention should broader international protection criteria as contained in UNHCR’s mandate and
regional instruments be examined, including subsidiary protection.7
Individuals who flee situations of violence where there is no nexus with a 1951 Convention ground
would not ordinarily come within the scope of the 1951 Convention. Such individuals may
nevertheless come within the terms of UNHCR’s broader mandate criteria, or the criteria set out in
regional instruments.

UNHCR’s mandate encompasses individuals who meet the refugee criteria under the 1951
Convention and its 1967 Protocol,8 but has been broadened through successive UN General Assembly
and ECOSOC resolutions to a variety of other situations of forced displacement, resulting from
indiscriminate violence or public disorder.9 In light of this evolution, UNHCR’s competence to
provide international protection to refugees extends to individuals who are outside their country of
origin or habitual residence and who are unable or unwilling to return there owing to serious threats to
life, physical integrity or freedom resulting from generalized violence or events seriously disturbing
public order.10
In the context of Afghanistan, indicators to assess the threat to life, physical integrity or freedom
resulting from generalized violence include: (i) the number of civilian casualties as a result of
indiscriminate acts of violence, including bombings, air strikes, suicide attacks, IED explosions and
landmines (see Section II.B.1); (ii) the number of conflict-related security incidents (see Section
II.B.2); and (iii) the number of people who have been forcibly displaced due to conflict (see Section
II.E). Such considerations are not, however, limited to the direct impact of the violence. They also
encompass the longer-term, more indirect consequences of conflict-related violence that, either alone
or on a cumulative basis, give rise to threats to life, physical integrity or freedom.
In the exceptional circumstances of Afghanistan, relevant considerations to assess the threat to life,
physical integrity or freedom resulting from events seriously disturbing public order include the fact
that in certain parts of the country the Government has lost effective control to AGEs and is unable to
provide protection to civilians. Available information indicates that the exercise of control over key
aspects of people’s lives in these areas is repressive, coercive and undermines an ordre public based
on respect for the rule of law and human dignity. Such situations are characterised by the systematic
use of intimidation and violence directed against the civilian population, in a climate of widespread
human rights abuses.
Against this background, UNHCR considers that individuals who originate from areas affected by
active conflict between pro-government forces and AGEs or from areas under the effective control of
AGEs as characterized above, may be in need of international protection. Those who are found not to
meet the refugee criteria of the 1951 Convention may be eligible for international protection under
UNHCR’s broader mandate on the grounds of serious threats to life, physical integrity or freedom
resulting from generalized violence or events seriously disturbing public order.
Afghans and others originating from Afghanistan who seek international protection in countries that
are States parties to the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa
(“1969 OAU Convention”) may qualify for refugee status under Article I(2) of that instrument, on the
grounds that they were compelled to leave their place of habitual residence owing to events seriously
disturbing public order in either part or the whole of Afghanistan.11 In the context of the 1969 OAU
Convention, the phrase “events seriously disturbing public order” encompasses situations of conflict
or violence that threaten civilians’ lives, freedom or security, as well as other serious disruptions of
the ordre public.12 For the same reasons as above, UNHCR considers that areas of Afghanistan that

are affected by active conflict as part of the ongoing struggle for control between pro-government
forces and AGEs, as well as areas of Afghanistan that are under the effective control of AGEs should
be regarded as areas affected by events seriously disturbing public order. Consequently, UNHCR
considers that individuals originating from such areas may be in need of international protection under
the terms of Article I(2) of the 1969 OAU Convention, on the grounds that they were compelled to
leave their place of habitual residence owing to threats to their lives, freedom or security as a result of
events seriously disturbing public order.
Afghan asylum-seekers who seek international protection in any of the countries that have
incorporated the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees (“Cartagena Declaration”) into their national
legislation may qualify for refugee status on the grounds that their lives, safety or freedom have been
threatened by generalized violence, internal conflict, massive violation of human rights or other
circumstances that have seriously disturbed public order.13 Following similar considerations as for
UNHCR’s broader mandate criteria and the 1969 OAU Convention, UNHCR considers that
individuals originating from areas in Afghanistan affected by active conflict between pro-government
forces and AGEs, or from areas under the effective control of AGEs, may be in need of international
protection under the terms of the Cartagena Declaration, on the grounds that their lives, safety or
freedom were threatened by circumstances that have seriously disturbed public order, either in the
form of direct or indirect consequences of conflict-related violence, or as a result of serious and
widespread human rights abuses committed by AGEs in areas under their effective control.
Afghans who seek international protection in Member States of the European Union (EU) and who
are found not to be refugees under the 1951 Convention may qualify for subsidiary protection under
Article 15 of EU Directive 2011/95/EU (Qualification Directive), if there are substantial grounds for
believing that they would face a real risk of serious harm in Afghanistan.14 In light of the available
evidence presented in Section II.C of these Guidelines, applicants may, depending on the individual
circumstances of the case, be in need of subsidiary protection under Article 15(a) or Article 15(b) on
the grounds that they would face a real risk of the relevant forms of serious harm (death penalty15 or
execution; or torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) either at the hands of the
State or its agents, or at the hands of AGEs.16 Equally, in light of the fact that Afghanistan continues
to be affected by a non-international armed conflict and in light of the evidence presented in Section
II.B, II.C, II.D and II.E of these Guidelines, applicants originating from or previously residing in
conflict-affected areas may, depending on the individual circumstances of the case, be in need of
subsidiary protection under Article 15(c) on the grounds that they would face a serious and individual
threat to their life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence.
Given the fluid nature of the conflict in Afghanistan, applications by Afghans for international
protection under UNHCR’s mandate or under the definitions contained in regional instruments should

reliable information about the situation in Afghanistan, giving due weight to the future-oriented nature
of assessments of protection needs.
Internal Flight or Relocation Alternative
An assessment of the availability of an internal flight or relocation alternative (IFA/IRA) requires an
assessment of the relevance as well as the reasonableness of the proposed IFA/IRA.17 An IFA/IRA is
relevant only if the proposed area of relocation is practically, safely and legally accessible, and if the
individual concerned would not be exposed to a further risk of persecution or serious harm in the area
of relocation. In assessing the relevance of an IFA/IRA for Afghan applicants, the following
considerations must be taken into account:
(i) The volatility and fluidity of the armed conflict in Afghanistan in terms of the difficulty of
identifying potential areas of relocation that are durably safe; and
(ii) The concrete prospects of safely accessing the proposed area of relocation, taking into account
the risks associated with the widespread use of IEDs and landmines throughout the country,
attacks and fighting taking place on roads, and restrictions on civilians’ freedom of movement
imposed by AGEs.
Where the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the State or its agents, there
is a presumption that consideration of an IFA/IRA is not relevant for areas under the control of the
State. In light of the available information about serious and widespread human rights abuses by
AGEs in areas under their effective control, as well as the inability of the State to provide protection
against such abuses in these areas, UNHCR considers that an IFA/IRA is not available in areas of the
country that are under the effective control of AGEs, with the possible exception of claimants with
previously-established links with the AGE leadership in the proposed area of relocation.
UNHCR considers that no IFA/IRA is available in areas affected by active conflict, regardless of the
actor of persecution.
Where the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of a non-State agent, the
ability of the agent to pursue the claimant to the area of proposed relocation needs to be assessed, as
well as the ability of the State to provide protection in that area. Where the agent of persecution is an
AGE, evidence about AGEs’ capacity to carry out attacks outside the areas under their effective
control needs to be taken into account.
For individuals who fear harm as a result of harmful traditional practices and religious norms of a
persecutory nature, such as women and children and LGBTI individuals, the endorsement of such
practices and norms by large segments of society and powerful conservative elements at all levels of
national and local government needs to be taken into account as a factor that weighs against the
relevance of an IFA/IRA.
Whether an IFA/IRA is “reasonable” must be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking fully into
account the security, human rights and humanitarian environment in the prospective area of relocation
at the time of the decision. In particular, the poor living conditions and precarious human rights
situation of Afghans who are currently internally displaced in Afghanistan are relevant considerations
that need to be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of a proposed internal flight or
relocation alternative. UNHCR considers that internal flight or relocation may be a reasonable
alternative only where the individual can expect to benefit from meaningful support of his or her own
(extended) family, community or tribe in the area of prospective relocation. The only exception to this
requirement of external support are single able-bodied men and married couples of working age
without identified vulnerabilities, who may in certain circumstances be able to subsist without family
and community support in urban and semi-urban areas that have the necessary infrastructure and
livelihood opportunities to meet the basic necessities of life and are under effective government

control. Given the breakdown in the traditional social fabric of society caused by decades of war,
mass refugee flows and internal displacement, a case-by-case analysis will, nevertheless, be
necessary.

A. Background
On 15 June 2014, President Juan Manuel Santos secured a second term in office, in an election
defined by the issue of peace.3 As part of his election platform, President Santos had undertaken to
continue peace talks to end more than 50 years of armed conflict between the State and guerrilla
groups,4 mainly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), but also the Ejército de
Liberación Nacional (ELN).5 Peace negotiations with the FARC began in October 2012 in Havana,
Cuba, and were ongoing as at May 2015.6 The negotiations with the FARC have been described as the
best chance in over a decade to put an end to hostilities."

a Constitutional Crisis
Crisis Group Asia Briefing N°152
Brussels, 31 October 2018
What’s new? On 26 October, Sri Lanka’s President Maithripala Sirisena abruptly
dismissed the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and appointed controversial
former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to the premier’s post, in a move that contravenes
the constitution and threatens to destabilise the country.
Why does it matter? Rajapaksa’s appointment has already emboldened his sup-
porters, with their actions provoking violence. More unrest is likely as the president
and the new prime minister seek to consolidate support. The struggle for power jeop-
ardises progress on reforms, ethnic reconciliation, and prospects for peaceful and
fair elections in 2019.
What should be done? The U.S., EU and other international actors should con-
tinue to urge Sirisena to reconvene parliament to select a prime minister through legal
channels. They should back these calls by making clear that Rajapaksa’s appointment,
if it stands, threatens the future of security and economic cooperation.
I. Overview
President Maithripala Sirisena’s unexpected decision on 26 October to sack Prime
Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and replace him with the former president, Mahinda
Rajapaksa, could seriously destabilise and set back Sri Lanka. In failing to follow
established legal procedures, Rajapaksa’s appointment, should it stand, would be the
country’s first ever unconstitutional transfer of power. The power struggle now
underway between Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe has already turned violent, with
the new prime minister’s supporters attempting to stop a recently ousted minister
from entering his office and clashing with his security detail. Risks of further blood-
shed are high, particularly if mass protests by Wickremesinghe loyalists continue
over the coming days. Questions over the legitimacy of Rajapaksa’s administration
could heighten tensions in the run-up to local and national elections scheduled over
the next year.
The U.S., EU, India and other governments with influence should press for par-
liament to be immediately convened so that Sri Lanka’s elected representatives can
choose a prime minister through constitutional procedures. The U.S., EU and Europe-
an governments should stress to President Sirisena that retaining Rajapaksa without
parliamentary approval jeopardises the future of economic support and security co-
operation.

II. An Unconstitutional Change of Power
The current crisis carries many contradictions. Sirisena was elected president in
January 2015 after he left then-president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s cabinet and challenged
him with the backing of Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP), a wide net-
work of civil society groups, and a small number from Sirisena’s – and Rajapaksa’s –
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Sirisena was elected on a platform of democratic
renewal and reconciliation, and backed by an unusual coalition of Tamil, Muslim
and more liberal Sinhalese voters. He promised to hold members of the Rajapaksa
administration and family accountable for alleged corruption and assassinations,
and to deliver justice for war crimes committed during the military campaign against
the Tamil Tigers. He also pledged to end the executive powers of the presidency,
which long have been criticised as anti-democratic and have contributed to Sri Lanka’s
history of political instability and grave human rights abuses.1
Within months of taking office, Sirisena won parliamentary approval for the 19th
amendment to the constitution, which weakened – but did not remove – the presi-
dent’s executive powers, restored the independence of several government oversight
bodies, and reimposed the two-term limit on the presidency, which Rajapaksa had
lifted in 2010. 2 In the August 2015 parliamentary elections, the UNP won a strong
plurality of votes and formed a national unity government with the United People’s
Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the coalition headed by Sirisena’s party.
The national unity government, headed jointly by Sirisena and Wickremesinghe,
succeeded in restoring media freedoms and the independence of the police and judi-
ciary, at least as compared to the situation under Rajapaksa. But its failure to improve
the economy for most Sir Lankans, widely publicised reports of ongoing corruption
by senior UNP figures – which they strenuously deny – and the lack of prosecutions
for high-profile crimes committed during the Rajapaksa presidency have severely
damaged its credibility as an engine of reform. The government has grown increas-
ingly unpopular over the past year, as the population contends with rising oil prices
and a falling rupee, and as Sirisena and Wickremesinghe have regularly and publicly
reversed each other’s policies – notably on the economy and ethnic reconciliation.
The president and the prime minister have never formed a strong working relation-
ship. Each has taken steps to undermine the trust and respect of the other.
The divisions and mistrust between the two men grew sharper after elections in
February 2018 when Rajapaksa’s newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna
(SLPP) won a large majority of local councils and humiliated both Sirisena’s and
Wickremesinghe’s parties, which campaigned more against each other than against
the SLPP. With the SLPP widely expected to win the next presidential and parlia-
mentary elections, Sirisena has struggled to find a way to remain in power after his
term expires at the end of 2019. Blaming the prime minister and the UNP for his
precarious situation, Sirisena has been actively searching for ways to remove Wick-
remesinghe. With the failure of a parliamentary no-confidence vote against Wickre-

mesinghe in March, which Sirisena was widely believed to support – he made little
secret of his desire to see the prime minister defeated – the president was known
to be in discussions with Rajapaksa and the SLPP about a new governing coalition.
Given Wickremesinghe’s ability to retain majority support in parliament, however, it
seemed Sirisena would be forced to maintain the status quo until the presidential
election due by November 2019.
The timing and the procedure used to remove Wickremesinghe as prime minister
on 26 October thus came as a surprise. Sirisena and supporters argue that the presi-
dent’s formal withdrawal of the SLFP-led UPFA from the national unity government
meant the cabinet was dissolved – and this in turn meant that the prime minister’s
position was vacated.3 Few independent constitutional experts accept this reasoning,
pointing to clear provisions in the constitution stipulating that the prime minister
can be removed only if the government has been defeated at the formal statement of
its policy during the first sitting of a new parliamentary session, at the presentation
of the budget or through a no-confidence vote. 4
Sirisena’s decision on 27 October to suspend parliament for three weeks suggests
that he and Rajapaksa do not believe that they have the votes yet to defeat Wickre-
mesinghe in the legislature. Suspending parliament further undermines the legality of
Wickremesinghe’s dismissal, who has from the beginning claimed he retains majority
support and demanded a chance to prove it in a vote. Sirisena’s and Rajapaksa’s
strategy seems to assume that they have a better chance of gaining a majority in par-
liament once the latter is installed alongside new cabinet ministers who control all
levers of state power, a process that began on 29 October. Sri Lanka has a long tradi-
tion of parliamentary crossovers from one party to another, which in the past allegedly
have been induced by offers of money and perks, and sometimes by threats. 5
Rajapaksa’s appointment has generated resistance among parliamentarians. The
speaker, Karu Jayasuriya, a veteran of the UNP but a man respected for his non-
partisan approach, has written to Sirisena challenging the prime minister’s removal
and calling on him to reconvene parliament. The head of the main Tamil party, the
Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, who is also the official
leader of the opposition, has written to the speaker and urged him to “uphold the
rule of law by summoning parliament forthwith”. 6 The leftist Janatha Vimukthi
Peramuna (JVP), a bitter critic of both Rajapaksa and the UNP, has also called for
parliament to be recalled immediately.
The levels of support Wickremsinghe and Rajapaksa currently enjoy in parliament
are uncertain. Prior to Wickremesinghe’s dismissal, the UNP had the backing of 106
parliamentarians, while Sirisena’s UPFA, now fully behind Rajapaksa, had 95. Were

the 225-member parliament to choose a new premier (likely through a vote of no
confidence in Rakapaksa), then 113 votes would carry the day. That said, were the
JVP’s six parliamentarians to abstain in their anger at both candidates, as most ob-
servers expect, 110 votes would be enough. In the days since Rajapaksa claimed the
prime minister’s office, he appears to have won the support of at least six additional
members, leaving him with nine more to win over.7 For Wickremesinghe to survive,
he will almost certainly require the backing of all sixteen votes from the Tamil party,
the TNA, which are not guaranteed.
An appeal by Wickremesinghe or others to the Supreme Court is possible. But the
Court is unlikely to intervene or to rule against Sirisena’s appointment of Rajapaksa.
That appointment has generated a great deal of criticism within politically engaged
circles in the capital Colombo and among UNP supporters, but there is as yet no sign
of widespread public resistance, in part because Rajapaksa remains popular among
many Sinhalese who make up three quarters of the population, and even more so
when contrasted with the increasingly dysfunctional Sirisena-Wickremesinghe “unity
government”."
